  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    I am currently an undergraduate student at Yuan Ze University, studying Computer Science. 
    My interests include data structures, algorithms, software development, and quantitative finance competitions.
  </p>

  <h2>Competition Experience</h2>
  <p>Here I share some of my experiences from academic competitions and related projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>WorldQuant Challenge</strong><br>
      Participated in quantitative research competition using WorldQuant Brain.  
      <p>
        In WorldQuant Brain, I designed and tested several small alphas (ideas) using data transformations and ranking logic.
        These alphas aimed to capture short-term momentum and long-term mean-reversion signals.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">
        Reflection: Through this platform, I realized the importance of systematic thinking in quantitative research.  
        Trial and error with many alpha ideas helped me better understand feature engineering, backtesting, and portfolio diversification.

  </ul>

  <h2>Side Projects</h2>
  <p>大三 side project</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>C++ Coursework</strong><br>
      Completed assignments involving data structures (linked lists, stacks, graphs) and memory management in C++.  
      <br>

      <p>
        I practiced pointer operations, object-oriented programming, and problem-solving skills through homework projects.  
        These experiences enhanced my debugging ability and deepened my understanding of algorithm complexity.
      </p>
      <p class="reflection">
        Reflection: The C++ course was challenging at first, but it provided me with a solid foundation in low-level programming concepts.  
        It also made me more confident in approaching real-world software projects.
